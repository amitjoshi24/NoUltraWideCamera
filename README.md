# NoUltraWideCamera 📸

NoUltraWideCamera is a minimalist iOS camera app that **prevents the use of the ultra-wide (0.5x) lens**. This is pretty much only useful when handing your phone to strangers to take a photo of you — ensuring **higher quality images** without worrying they'll accidentally switch to the low-res 0.5x lens. 

I actually love the ultra-wide camera for landscape pictures, but when it comes to photos of people, it leads to distortion (fish-bowl effect) and suboptimal resolution, especially in low-light (especially on old phones such as my iPhone 11 Pro Max). If ultra-wide is needed, simply use the normal Camera app that comes with iPhones, as my app was never meant to replace it.
